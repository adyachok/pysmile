pysmile
=======

Python wrapper for the SMILE Bayesian Network Library
available at [genie.sis.pitt.edu](http://genie.sis.pitt.edu/)

This project consists only of a few [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/)
configuration files which can be used to create a fully useable
Python package which wraps most of SMILE and SMIlearn features.

Sorry, no real documentation yet.

BUILD Requirements
------------------

You will require the SMILE and SMIlearn library headers for your platform,
as well as the SWIG executables. Look into the accompanying .sh files to
get started.
